<p> Paragraph 2 <p> 
I chose to idolize Lupita Nyong'o because she inspires me. She was the first dark- African woman that I had ever seen in movies and it was nice to see someone who looked like me, someone who represented my culture in some of the movies she did like Black Panther. She also inspires my fashion choices because she is a major icon in the fashion industry with apperances in magazines like Vogue for her fashion choices.
