A girl named Sam was walking her dog in the park. Sam came across a store selling her dream moped. All she ever wanted to buy a moped so she could get to all the places she wanted to go. Sam had to figure out a way to get that moped. She asked all her friends to help her come up with 300$ so she could buy that moped. Sam started doing a lot of odd jobs so she could get the moped. Her friends pitched in as well. A few weeks later she was finally able to make up all the money to buy that moped.
